# auto-dark-mode-extension
## Auto Dark Mode for All Websites is a free browser extension that automatically applies a dark theme to any website even if it doesn’t support dark mode. It uses smart CSS filters and heuristics to invert colors without breaking page layout or media. You can toggle dark mode per-site, and the extension remembers your choices for future visits.
